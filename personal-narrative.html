    <h1>My Personal Narrative</h1>
      <h2>Dominique Mortelliti</h2>
    
        <p>I came into this final project thinking that I would be able to create a cute and complex website that was obviously out of my beginners reach. I jumped in head first trying to create a website that had cool effects with the navigation bar and carousels to quickly find out that this was not the course where I needed to do all that, maybe next semester. So I gave up that thought and went with a different, more basic approach. I believe that my website shows what I have learned in this class while also showing my personality through my styles, techniques and the challenges I have faced through this coding adventure.
First I am going to discuss what I learned and the challenges I faced in my final. If you look at my final website it shows everything I have learned how to do. Background image, fading background color with borders, playing with bootstrap and learning how to make every page have the same styling. I think what was most difficult was creating margins and making the pages look put together. It was hard figuring out what was going wrong on some of my pages when they were all linked up to the same CSS file which was very frustrating but once I figured it out, it was like ‘duh, that was silly.’ I also had a very difficult time with the mass header and footer. Since I got them off of bootstrap their code for the header and footer was overwhelming. I think making that look perfect and making sure all of the links worked correctly was one of the more difficult parts of this project. But overall, even with all the challenges I really enjoyed seeing the final product come together.</p>
        <p>I believe my personality shines through my final website in many different ways. I started my website by having a dark purple background and then having fun colors for all the different text. I believe this looked very unprofessional (even though I loved the colors) and the audience could barely read the text. So I started looking up backgrounds that were dark purple. I knew from the beginning that I wanted flowers as the background image because when I think flowers, I think girly. I am in some ways a big girly girl and in other ways the complete opposite. So, I dropped the thought of having a purple background and decided more of browns and cream colors, but I left my borders dark purple. I thought having flowers but with more plain colors would show how I was girly, but not overly girly, more plain and simple. I also really liked what I did for my resume page in my project portfolio, having borders but decided to add a faded background, which is something different we learned how to do in class.</p> 
        <p>I really enjoyed having cursive headers because they’re pretty. But I made my main text a big sort of computer-text like font. I thought it was very pleasing to the eye while also having a hint of me because that is the way my handwriting is: big and bubbly. The techniques I decided to use were the ones I did in my first ever resume page. I wanted my website to have a sort of structure but also be creative and not exactly the same. Which is why not every text box is the same. I created text boxes that are next to each other, while others have pictures etc. But overall there is still a type of structure that makes the website look put together, professional and structured. I know that my website could have looked a bit more professional but I also wanted it to be fun. I mean my goal for this site was to advertise myself to potential clients, companies, etc. It is a way for people to see me in a different type of way then just looking at a boring resume or interview; everything they need to know about me is right on the website.</p> 
        <p>In conclusion, I really enjoyed creating my own personal website. I learned a lot of web design basic in this class while also being able to practice these skills on my own. I was able to create different things without having a structure that I needed to follow. I believe the best part about creating this website was that I was allowed to let my imagination run and see what I came up with without someone telling me what my website should look like. It did take a very good chunk of time to create, but I believe I accomplished my goal, and learned a lot in the process.</p>
