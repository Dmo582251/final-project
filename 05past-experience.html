    <h1> My Past Work Experience</h1>
  <div class="yapple"> 
    <h2>Yapple Yogurt(Senior Year of Highschool)</h2>
    <p>In my highschool days, a new type of dessert place became very popular: they called it Froyo(Frozen Yogurt). Pinkberry was the first major froyo company but soon enough it became a trending type of dessert. Different froyo brands started popping up on almost every corner of my hometown therefore creating a great deal of job oppurtunity for students in highschool and college.I enjoyed working here maybe because it was my first work experience besides babysitting or maybe because I worked with all people my age. But either way, I must've been doing a good job because I ended up becoming assistant manager. I believe this was a great first job for me to have and if you're ever in the area of Wynnewood PA, you should check it out!</p>

    <h2>Goddard Systems Inc.(Summer Intern going into sophomore year)</h2>
    <p>Summer going into my sophomore year of college I interned for the company Goddard Systems Inc. It is a franchised company for early childhood education and child care. The company is on the smaller side but when I worked there they were celebrating opening the 400th school in the United States. I enjoyed my time working there because they gave me projects everyday to complete. My days were booked everyday whether from sitting in on meetings or just completing on going projects. This company gave me great experience with excel, mircosoft office, LinkedIn and dealing with printers / copiers.</p>

  <div class="evoke">
  <h2>Evoke Health (Summer Intern going into Junior year)</h2>
    <p>Summer going into my junior year of college I worked at a Evoke Health. Evoke is a full service healthcare marketing firm. Some companies they work with are Allergan, Gilead, and Amgen. I enjoyed working there because number one, I was in the New York city which is a completely different experience then working in Philadelphia and two, because the company was very fun and young. They had me creating competitive decks, sitting in meetings with clients and helping out with their drug advertisement Jublia. The overall experience was great and I enjoyed every second of it.</p>
